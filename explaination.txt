2. loader: load executable file and standard libraries to load them in memory so we turn this program into process in execution 

you'll find comments in files explaining the codes 
3. to run: gcc name.c -o out ( -o out means that i want to make the output file"out"  in a specific format )

write sleep 100 & (where sleep is the name of the process , 100 is the number of the process, & refers to running the process in the background 
5. jobs command produce all the process in the background
6.to stop the process: kill -STOP idOfTheProcess 
7, to resume the process: 
kill -CONT idOFTheProcess
8, to delete the process:
